# Discord-Webhook-IP-logger 

1. **Clone the project**: First, users need to clone the project from your GitHub repository to their local machine.

2. **Update the `config.json` file**: Users must replace the placeholder text `"your webhook hereüëç"` in the `config.json` file with their webhook URL.

3. **Host the web page**: Users should host the web page on a server or use a local web server for testing purposes. They can use a simple HTTP server like Python's `http.server`, Apache, or Nginx.

4. **Visit the web page**: When users access the web page, they will see a message saying "Checking your browser...". The JavaScript code will run in the background and collect the user's IP address, user agent, and location data.

5. **Data is sent to the webhook**: The collected data will be sent to the webhook URL specified in the `config.json` file. The webhook can be a Discord webhook, Slack webhook, or any other service that accepts incoming webhook requests.

6. **View collected data**: Users can view the collected data in the platform they have set up to receive webhook messages. For example, if they are using Discord, they will see a message containing the user's IP address, user agent, and location data in the specified channel.
